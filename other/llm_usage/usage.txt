user: cleaning data taking forever to load

The R code snippet you shared seems to involve filtering data from a grocery dataset (grocery) to extract rows where the product_name contains "bacon" but excludes rows with certain unwanted terms. If it's taking a long time to load or process, here are some suggestions for optimizing or debugging the issue:Check Dataset Size
If grocery is a large dataset, the filtering process may take time. Use dim(grocery) or nrow(grocery) to check its size.
Consider sampling the dataset (grocery %>% sample_n(1000)) for testing. 

user: Does Loblaw have frequent discounts on bagels

Loblaw frequently offers discounts on bagels, often through promotions and coupons. For instance, earlier this year, they featured a "Buy One Get One Free" deal on D’Italiano with Gusto! bagels, combined with PC Optimum points, effectively reducing the price per package to as low as $0.99.

To stay informed about current bagel promotions, you can regularly check Loblaw's weekly flyer and coupon sections on their website.

 Additionally, subscribing to their newsletter or following their social media channels can provide timely updates on upcoming deals.

Keep in mind that promotions vary by location and time, so it's advisable to verify the latest offers at your local Loblaw store in Toronto.

user: rocery_raw <- read.csv('data/01-raw_data/grocery_raw.parquet')
Error in make.names(col.names, unique = TRUE) :

In addition: Warning messages:

2: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :

6: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :
  incomplete final line found by readTableHeader on 'data/01-raw_data/grocery_raw.parquet'

The error occurs because read.csv is designed for reading CSV files, while your file (grocery_raw.parquet) is a Parquet file. Parquet files require a specialized package for reading, as they have a binary format not compatible with read.csv.

Solution: Use the arrow or sparklyr package to read Parquet files.

Here’s how to handle this issue:

1. Install and load the arrow package
The arrow package provides support for reading and writing Parquet files.

2. Validate the File
If you still encounter errors, the file might be corrupted. Check its integrity using:

A tool like Apache Arrow CLI or pyarrow in Python.
Ensure the file is in the expected directory (data/01-raw_data).

3. Handling Multibyte Strings
If column names or data contain invalid characters, you can sanitize them:

The error Missing } inserted in your LaTeX document indicates that there is a problem with unbalanced or improperly used braces {} in your code, particularly in the section involving the align environment. Additionally, your $ usage in the math environment might be problematic. Here's how to address this:




user: Caused by warning in ifelse():
! NAs introduced by coercion

The warning NAs introduced by coercion in ifelse() typically occurs when the ifelse() function attempts to coerce a value to a type that doesn't match the expected format (e.g., numeric, character, etc.). This often happens when:

Type Mismatch:

The ifelse() function coerces all its arguments (yes and no) to a common type. If there’s a mismatch (e.g., numeric and character), it tries to coerce values and may introduce NA for incompatible data.
Invalid Conversion:

When converting from one type to another (e.g., as.numeric("abc")), invalid values result in NA.
